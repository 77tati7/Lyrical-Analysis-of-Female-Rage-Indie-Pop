This research uses a thorough lyrical analysis to look at how Olivia Rodrigo and Lana Del Rey express female despair and rage in their music. Olivia Rodrigo uses succinct, emotionally charged language to highlight personal authenticity and profound emotional experiences. Olivia Rodrigo represents a modern-day Gen Z viewpoint. On the other hand, Lana Del Rey, a member of the Millennial generation, explores intricate themes of longing, nostalgia, and social criticism using a rich and varied language with nuanced frequencies. Distinct style decisions are shown by statistical analysis of word lengths and frequencies: Del Rey's lyrical depth and narrative intricacy contrasts with Rodrigo's clear and quick approach. These results shed light on the disparities across generations in musical expression and reveal the many ways that contemporary musicians interpret and convey issues of female emotionality.
